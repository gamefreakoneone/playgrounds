 <hr>

I just posted a ‘not funny didn’t laugh’ (or similar) image in response to your meme. This is why.

This can be due to many reasons, such as but not limited to:<br>

Your<a id="tesla" > meme </a> did not make me laugh I don’t like you in particular Your meme involved anime<br>

FAQ:<br>

Q: how can I better my humor and be a better person? A: Make or find funnier memes.<br>
Q: Why do you post this in response to an anime meme? A: Anime is not funny, please delete your account<br>
Q: Why did you post this if there is no meme present? A: I may have posted the ‘not funny didn’t laugh’ (or of similar caption) image simply because I found the ‘not funny didn’t laugh’ (or of similar caption) image itself to be funny.

Thank you for your time, please use this information to better your humor.<br>

    <strong>Here is a nice story!<br></strong>
</p>
<p id="tryout">
    You sit on the toilet to poop, but the poop never stops coming out of your butt. You have to start flushing the toilet every two minutes to keep up.The poop accelerates.
    <br> You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends. You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is dead.
    <br> Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. The poop accelerates. You are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates.
     <br>The shovelers abandon the buckets and shovel out the window. The poop accelerates. A candlelight vigil forms around your house.<br>
      One of the workers falls over and drowns. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles you out the window. You land in the pile.<br> The poop accelerates.
      <br> The force now propels you forward and upward. Vigils grab at your legs. The poop ignites from their candles. The Facebook live event hits 1 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. The torrent underneath you is deafening. 5 million Facebook live viewers. You try to close up shop but your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You are now tracked on radar. You try to change your angle of ascent but you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. NORAD upgrades to DEFCON 3. Concentric circles of fire engulf your city. The poop accelerates. You have broken the sound barrier. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records you've broken. 200,000 feet. You are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness.
    <br> The poop accelerates.
